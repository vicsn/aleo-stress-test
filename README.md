# Aleo Stress Testing

You can test this program on a local devnet. First, set up the devnet. Development private keys and addresses are printed to the terminal. Because the devnet runs in tmux, You can scroll up using `ctrl+b+[`. Be quick because history is limited by default.

```
git clone github.com/aleoHQ/snarkOS
cd snarkOS
./devnet.sh
```

Then run the `test.sh` script from the folder in this repository.
